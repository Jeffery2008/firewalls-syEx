# iptablesToSMT

The iptablesToSMT tool works in three main steps:

1. Parse iptables rules from a save file into an internal representation
2. Generate C code that simulates the firewall behavior
3. Use KLEE symbolic execution to generate SMT formulas representing all possible paths through the firewall

## Prerequisites

- Docker (for running KLEE)
- Python 3.x
- iptables

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

2. Start the KLEE Docker container:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/home/klee/workspace klee/klee
```

3. Inside the container, navigate to the workspace directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd workspace
./install.sh
```

## Usage

1. Save your iptables rules to a file using:
```bash
iptables-save > rules.txt
```

2. Run the conversion tool:
```bash
python3 index.py
```

This will:
- Parse the iptables rules
- Generate equivalent C code
- Use KLEE to produce SMT formulas for each possible path through the firewall
- Combine the formulas into a single representation of the firewall's behavior

## Output

The tool generates:
- Two SMT formulas representing the firewall's behavior (one for DROP and ACCEPT actions)
